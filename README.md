### GBS: Graph-Based System for Multi-view Clustering

This repo hosts the code for paper "A Study of Graph-based System for Multi-view Clustering", Knowledge-Based Systems, 2019.

A simple way is to run _Run_GBS.m_ or _Run_GBS_toy.m_.

#### Some notes
1. Run_GBS: Experiments on real-word data (eight real-world datasets).
   Please set 'choice_graph' and 'choice_metric' to use different graph metrices. (Preferred our method)
2. Run_GBS_toy: Experiments on toy data (one toy/two-moon dataset)
3. GBS: Multi-view clustering methods building upon GBS
