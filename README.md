### GBS: Graph-Based System for Multi-view Clustering

To whom it may concern,

This work is under review. We will give the details as soon as possible.
To verify the effectiveness of our method, the simple way is to run the corresponding startup, i.e.,
Run_GBS.m or Run_GBS_toy.m.

#### some notes
1. Run_GBS: Experiments on real-word data (eight real-world datasets).
   Please set 'choice_graph' and 'choice_metric' to use different graph metrices. (Default is our proposed method.)
2. Run_GBS_toy: Experiments on toy data (two-moon dataset)
3. GBS: Multi-view Clustering Method on GBS

The code here assists reviewers to check our work. Please do not use them elsewhere.

If any questions, please do not hesitate to contact Hao Wang (Email: cshaowang@gmail.com).

Sincerely yours,
Hao
