### GBS: Graph-Based System for Multi-view Clustering

To whom it may concern,

For the purpose of reproducibility, we released our GBS system here. The simple way is to run the corresponding startup, i.e.,
Run_GBS.m or Run_GBS_toy.m.

#### Some notes
1. Run_GBS: Experiments on real-word data (eight real-world datasets).
   Please set 'choice_graph' and 'choice_metric' to use different graph metrices. (Default is our proposed method.)
2. Run_GBS_toy: Experiments on toy data (two-moon dataset)
3. GBS: Multi-view clustering methods building upon GBS

If there are any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me (Email: cshaowang@gmail.com).

Sincerely yours,
Hao WANG
